=====================
Report MRP BOM Matrix
=====================

The Matrix Bill of Materials is a report that shows connections between all
parents and all components.

This report helps to identify the products that are used in lots of
assemblies or finished products.

If a raw material/assembly is used in many parent assemblies/finished
products, it is likely that you'd want to make sure that you never run
out of it.


Usage
=====

* Go to 'Manufacturing / Master Data / BOM Matrix'.
