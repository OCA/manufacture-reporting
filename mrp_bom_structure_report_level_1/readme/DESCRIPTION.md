This module adds a PDF report in BoM's to print just the first level of
components. So, if you have a Bill of Materials (A) for which one of the Components also has a Bill of Materials (B),
the report will only display the Components within the first level for the selected Bill of Materials (A),
but not the Components from the Bill of Materials (B).
